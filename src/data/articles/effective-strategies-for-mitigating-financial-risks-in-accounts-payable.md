# Account Payables Risk Management

A poorly managed AP department might cause major complications. It may become transactional, collecting invoices and paying them without preventing fraud or duplicate payments. Such concerns can harm any company. Therefore, an account payables risk assessment is necessary to move to a more strategic position and maintain AP department efficiency. This procedure identifies financial and process threats, protecting the company's money and operations.

Accounts payable risk assessments differ from audits. An audit reviews AP records for correctness, but a risk assessment checks AP processes, including internal payment controls, to detect and fix flaws. This assessment allows workflow optimisation and compliance, improving efficiency and operational excellence.

Risk assessments consider external and internal fraud, rogue expenditures, conflicts of interest, payment problems and delays, and liability visibility. By addressing these areas, organisations can drastically minimise financial risks and improve AP procedures. An efficient AP department maintains vendor relationships, provides cash flow visibility, and saves money. AP is strategic in the company's financial management.

## What is an Accounts Payable Risk Assessment?

An accounts payable (AP) risk assessment is a systematic process aimed at identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing the various risks associated with the AP process. This proactive approach is crucial for managing AP risks effectively and brings several benefits to an organization:

* Reduction in Fraud and Errors: By thoroughly assessing the AP process, organizations can significantly lower the likelihood of fraud and errors, which are common pitfalls in financial management.
    
* Improved Accuracy and Efficiency: A well-conducted risk assessment leads to a more accurate and efficient AP process, ensuring that payments are processed correctly and on time.
    
* Protection of Financial Assets: The assessment helps in safeguarding the organization's financial assets from potential threats like fraud, errors, and inefficiencies.
    
* Enhanced Compliance with Regulations: It ensures that the AP process is in line with various regulatory requirements, thus avoiding legal complications and penalties.
    

**The AP risk assessment process typically involves the following steps:**

* Identifying the AP Process: This step encompasses understanding all the steps involved in processing and paying invoices, from the receipt of the invoice to the final payment.
    
* Identifying Risks at Each Step: Risks are identified at each stage of the AP process. This can be achieved through brainstorming sessions with AP staff, reviewing past audit findings, and researching common AP fraud schemes.
    
* Evaluating the Likelihood and Impact of Each Risk: This evaluation helps in prioritizing the risks and determining which ones need immediate attention.
    
* Designing and Implementing Controls: Based on the identified risks, appropriate controls are designed and implemented. This could include procedural changes, the adoption of new software solutions, or staff training.
    
* Regular Monitoring and Review: Continuous monitoring and periodic review of the AP risk assessment are essential to ensure the effectiveness of the controls and to identify and address new risks promptly.

## Best Practices to Mitigate Accounts Payable Risks

![Best Ways to Mitigate Accounts Payable Risks](/img/articles/best-ways-to-mitigate-accounts-payable-risks.jpg "Best Ways to Mitigate Accounts Payable Risks")

To effectively manage and mitigate the risks associated with accounts payable, organizations can adopt several best practices. These practices not only help in reducing the likelihood of fraud and errors but also enhance the overall efficiency and compliance of the AP process.

### Implement Strong Internal Controls

* Segregation of Duties: Assign different aspects of the AP process to different employees. For instance, the person approving invoices should not be the same person making the payments.
    
* Dual Approval for Large Payments: Require two signatures or approvals for substantial payments to ensure proper authorization.
    
* Regular Reconciliations: Conduct frequent reconciliations of AP records with bank statements to verify the accuracy and timeliness of payments.

### Train Employees on AP Procedures and Policies

* Ensure that employees are well-versed in identifying and reporting suspicious activities.

### Regularly Review AP Records and Systems

* Conduct regular audits to identify weaknesses in internal controls and systems.
    
* Monitor AP data for trends and anomalies that might indicate fraud or errors.
    

### Specific Controls for Specific Risks

* To mitigate the risk of vendor disputes, establish clear payment terms and conditions and communicate these to vendors in writing.
    
* Implement a process for efficiently resolving vendor disputes.
    

### Additional Controls

* Use a Purchase Order System: Helps track authorized purchases and prevent unauthorized spending.
    
* Implement a Three-Way Match Process: Match invoices to purchase orders and receiving reports before making payments to prevent duplicate payments and payments for undelivered goods or services.

## FAQ’s 

### What are the controls in AP?

To control accounts payable well, companies should have strong internal controls, use technology to make the AP process more automatic, train employees on AP procedures and policies, and regularly check AP records and systems to find and fix any problems. This includes doing audits often and watching AP data for patterns or things that don't look right.

### How do you control accounts payable effectively?

To manage accounts payable (AP) effectively and minimize financial risks, organizations use various controls. These controls are essential for preventing fraud, errors, and compliance issues. 

* They include preventive controls, which stop fraud and errors before they happen, like segregating duties, needing two approvals for big payments, and matching invoices to purchase orders and receiving reports. 
    
* Detective controls find fraud and errors that have already happened. This involves checking AP records regularly, looking for unusual data, and investigating any strange activities. 
    
* Corrective controls fix fraud and errors once they're found, like getting back money from fraudulent payments, fixing invoice mistakes, and taking action against employees who break rules.
    

### What are the 4 types of financial risks?

There are four main kinds of financial risks: credit risk, which is when someone might not pay back a loan; market risk, which is when the value of an investment goes down; operational risk, which is when something goes wrong in operations, like a computer problem or a natural disaster, causing financial loss; and reputational risk, which is when bad publicity hurts the organization's reputation and leads to financial loss.

### What are two strategies for mitigating risk?

To reduce risk, two main strategies are used: risk avoidance, which means staying away from activities that could lead to losses, and risk transfer, which means giving the risk to someone else, like an insurance company.

### What is the most commonly used risk mitigation strategy?

The most common way to reduce risk is risk avoidance. This is the most effective way to get rid of risk. However, it's not always possible or practical to avoid risk. In those cases, organizations might transfer the risk to someone else or use other ways to reduce risk.
