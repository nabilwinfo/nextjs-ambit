Paying bills is a major concern for any business, so let's talk about it. There is a more efficient way to do this that will help your company save money. Early payment discounts are what they're called. Here, you might receive a small discount by paying your bills a little early. 

Being ahead of the game is like getting a little reward. Plus, everyone loves a good bargain, doesn't they? How can you put these savings to work for your company? Let's find out.

## What are Early Payment Discounts in Accounts Payable?

Sellers give Early Payment Discounts (EPDs) to customers who pay their bills before the due date. EPDs are basically a cash reward. A small percentage of the invoice amount is generally given as a discount. This is good for both parties. It's a smart move for businesses to speed up cash flow and lower days sales outstanding (DSO), which is a key measure in financial analysis. For buyers, it means they can save money, which can be a very appealing offer.

Discounts for paying your bills early are like a small thank you from the business to the customer for paying their bills on time. The buyer saves money and the business gets its money faster. A business needs to build trust with its people in order to make money, but it's not just about the money.

## Types of Early Payment Discount

It's important to know the differences between the different types of early payment discounts before you pick one.

1. **Static Discount:** This is what most places give as a deal. It's like a store's quick sale. It's a simple deal: if you pay your bill really quickly, like within 10 days, they take a small amount off, maybe 2% or so.


2. **[Dynamic Discount](https://tipalti.com/dynamic-discounting/):** This one works like a game: the faster you pay, the more you save. You could save 5% if you pay the bill the next day. Maybe it will go down to 4% in a few days. It's all about how fast you are.


3. **Quantity Discount:** This one's for people who buy a lot. People will give you a deal if you buy a lot of things from them. Let's say you spend more than $10,000, and they might give you a 2% discount. If you spend more than $25,000, that discount might go up to 5%.

## Early Payment Discount Example

Imagine you're running a business, and you've got a bunch of customers who buy things from you. Now, you need to make sure they pay you back quickly because cash is always better than debt. So, you make a deal with your customers: "**Hey, if you pay me back in 10 days instead of 30 days, I'll knock 2% off of what you owe me.**"

Here's how it works in simple terms:

● You sell something for **$1,000**.

● You offer a **2%** discount if the customer pays in **10 days.**

● The customer thinks, **"Cool, I can save $20 and only pay $980 if I pay early."**

● If they don't pay early, they just pay the regular **$1,000 in 30 days.**

This is a win-win. Your customer saves some money, and you get your cash faster, which you can use to grow your business or just keep things running smoothly.

Now, there are a few different ways you can set up these discounts, but the idea is to make it tempting for the customer to pay early without hurting your own profits.

And remember, it's important to keep things clear. No one likes confusing deals. Make sure your customers understand the discount and the time frame they have to pay.

## FAQ’s

### How are discounts considered in accounts payable?

In accounts payable, discounts are looked at in two main ways:

● Gross method: This is where you write down the whole amount of the invoice as what you owe. If you pay it off early and get a discount, you just mark that discount as a savings in your books.

● Net method: Here, you only write down the amount you owe after taking off the discount right when you get the invoice. When you pay, you just record the amount after the discount.

Which way you use depends on how your company likes to do its accounting.

### How do you write payment terms with discounts?

When you're writing down payment terms with discounts, it usually looks something like "2/10, net 30". This means if the buyer pays up within 10 days, they get a 2% discount. If not, they need to pay the full price in 30 days.

Other ways to write it might be **"3/10, net 30" or "5/10, net 30"** – it's all about how much discount you get and how fast you need to pay to get it.

### Which type of discount is used to encourage early payment?

The discount we use to get people to pay sooner is called an early payment discount. It's a little thank you in the form of a percent off the invoice for paying it before it's actually due. This helps the seller get money faster and gives the buyer a nice little saving.

Here are a few examples:

● 2/10, net 30: Save 2% if you pay in 10 days.

● 3/10, net 30: Save 3% for paying early.

● 5/10, net 30: Get a 5% discount for quick payment.

The better the discount and the quicker the payment time, the more likely the buyer is to pay fast.
