## What is ecommerce accounting?

Ecommerce accounting involves the systematic recording, organization, and management of all financial data and transactions specifically related to the operation of an ecommerce company. It is a specialized subset of small business accounting designed to address the unique requirements of ecommerce providers.

At its core, accounting is the process of tracking and documenting transactions, classifying them as income or expenses. While it may seem straightforward, the terminology used in accounting can sometimes be overwhelming, especially for those new to business finances. To simplify matters, here are key components of ecommerce accounting:

1. **Purchase order:** A purchase order is a legally binding document issued by a client, specifying the quantity and type of items to be purchased, along with the agreed-upon price. Although it does not constitute payment, a purchase order should include payment details. Businesses may use purchase orders to request raw materials from vendors, while clients may submit them to request specific goods or services.
2. **Sales order:** A sales order is a document prepared by the seller (often in response to a purchase order) that outlines the details of a sale. It includes client information, a description and quantity of goods sold, sale amount, payment information, and delivery address and date.
3. **Accounts payable and accounts receivable:** These terms refer to outstanding bills, invoices, and the total amount of expenses yet to be paid or revenue yet to be received.
4. **Cost of goods sold (COGS):** COGS represents the total cost incurred in the production and distribution of a product. It typically includes expenses such as shipping, warehousing, credit card fees, and other costs directly associated with selling products. Overhead expenses like payroll, marketing, software licenses, and office space are not included.
5. **Ecommerce sales tax:** This refers to the tax paid by an ecommerce business to the state in which a purchaser resides. It depends on whether a sales tax nexus exists between the seller and the state, meaning the state has the authority to tax the business. Typically, a nexus is established if the business conducts any economic activity in the state.

## What does ecommerce accounting entail?

Like all business accounting, [ecommerce accounting](https://www.ambitkpo.com/article/e-commerce-bookkeeping-a-comprehensive-guide) includes:

* Basic bookkeeping functions, like managing invoicing, payroll, and balance sheets
* More sophisticated planning and reporting functions, like preparing financial statements and creating a strategic tax plan

Tax management, bookkeeping, and growth planning are often three major areas of emphasis.

### Tax management

[Tax management](https://www.ambitkpo.com/services/tax-service) can be complicated, and mistakes in filing or interpreting the tax code can have serious consequences for business owners. That’s why tax management (including both tax planning and preparation) is a core service of many accounting firms.

Ecommerce tax management includes tracking and remitting all applicable state and local taxes, calculating and filing quarterly estimated taxes, year-end filing, and distributing 1099s to contract workers.

Determining when an ecommerce seller must charge sales tax can be complicated—and is made more so by the fact that different states are governed by different rules. In general, if a seller has significant business in a state (also known as sales tax nexus), that seller is responsible for collecting and remitting state taxes for any purchase made from that state.

An ecommerce company always has a sales tax nexus in the state where the business is headquartered. Other common triggers include having a physical location or warehouse, an employee or a shipping partner in a state, visiting a state for a trade show, or exceeding a certain dollar amount in sales in a particular state.

### Bookkeeping

Accurate bookkeeping is a baseline requirement for all [business planning](https://www.ambitkpo.com/services/tax-return) and operations. This includes tracking and categorizing income and expenses, inventory management , and reviewing balance sheets.

It also includes tracking customer returns , a convenience that can both enhance customer loyalty and cause a bookkeeping headache. Improperly tracked, one return can throw off your sales, inventory , expenses, forecasting, and sales tax records all at once.

An ecommerce accounting system should take into account customer returns and allow you to accept returns without throwing off your financial reports.

### Planning for growth

Scaling a business is an exhilarating endeavor, and ecommerce accounting plays a pivotal role in this process. It goes beyond being a mere task for business owners; it serves as a means to gather essential information that propels them towards their business objectives.

Ecommerce accounting enables you to analyze various aspects, such as:

1. **Identifying the most profitable products or services for your company.**
2. **Tracking the changes in your profits over time.**
3. **Assessing your significant expenses and liabilities.**
4. **Identifying opportunities to enhance your profit margins.**

Moreover, it provides financial benchmarking that aids in evaluating the success of new ventures. For instance, you can measure the return on investment (ROI) for a marketing campaign. This strategic insight assists in making informed decisions, such as acquiring a competitor or exploring cost-saving options like warehousing in another state. It also helps you anticipate your next busy season and ensure preparedness.

Additionally, ecommerce accounting encompasses generating crucial financial reports, including profit and loss statements and cash flow statements. These reports act as an owner's manual for your business, offering comprehensive insights into the inner workings of your company, consolidated in a single location.

## What do ecommerce business owners need to keep track of?

Business accounting involves the meticulous tracking of a company's transactions, inventory, and financial data. This encompasses crucial metrics like cash flow, gross profit, balance sheets, and profit and loss (P&L) statements.

1. **Cash flow:** Cash flow refers to the movement of money into and out of your business. Effective cash flow management ensures meeting obligations and prevents unintended debt.
2. **Gross profit:** Gross profit is a fundamental metric for business operations, calculated as total revenue minus the cost of goods sold. The formula for gross profit is: gross profit = revenue - cost of goods sold.
3. **Gross margins:** Derived from the same data as gross profit, gross margins are expressed as a percentage of total revenue. The formula is: gross margins = (revenue - cost of goods sold) / revenue. For example, if your company generates $10,000 in revenue with $4,000 as the cost of goods sold, the gross profit is $6,000, resulting in a gross margin of 60%.
4. **Balance sheets:** A balance sheet includes three major categories: assets (such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventory), liabilities (including accounts payable, wages, and income tax), and the combined equity of all shareholders.
5. **Profit and loss (P&L) statements:** P&L statements provide a comprehensive view of your business's profitability during a specific period. They calculate total revenue minus all costs associated with operations, including COGS, marketing expenses, payroll, and overhead. A positive figure indicates a profit, while a negative figure signifies a loss.

## Accounting methods for ecommerce sellers

There are many different accounting providers available—from accounting software platforms to traditional accounting firms. Before getting started with a vendor, however, you’ll need to choose an accounting method.

The two accounting methods are cash accounting and accrual accounting. An ecommerce company can use either method, but not both at once. Switching methods requires filing paperwork with the IRS.

### Cash basis accounting

Cash accounting is a method of accounting that measures the transfer of cash.

Here’s an example of how cash basis accounting works:

Seems simple, right? Under this method, you might receive a purchase order for an $800 handmade coffee table, make the table, and then ship the table to your client. Under a cash accounting method, you only record income from the table when the purchaser’s payment lands in your account.

The same goes for expenses. You might owe a videographer $10,000 for a series of product videos to be completed at the beginning of Q2, but because that $10,000 is still in your bank account at the end of Q1, you’ll end up paying taxes on it during the first quarter. For accounting purposes, this debt only matters once the money leaves your account.

### Accrual accounting

Accrual accounting differs from cash accounting in that it recognizes transactions when revenues are earned or expenses are incurred, regardless of when the actual payment is made.

The accrual method is primarily utilized by larger companies and necessitates specialized accounting knowledge and a hands-on approach to account management compared to the cash basis method.

While accrual accounting provides a more precise depiction of a company's financial position, it is also more intricate than cash basis accounting. It is the method mandated by generally accepted accounting principles [(GAAP)](https://www.ambitkpo.com/article/the-importance-of-us-accounting-standards-for-businesses).

**Here's how it operates:**

Accrual accounting offers a more comprehensive view of a business's long-term financial status. However, it can sometimes mislead business owners about the present state of their accounts. For instance, using the example of the coffee-table maker mentioned earlier, she would "earn" $800 as soon as she completes the table, even if her business bank account remains empty.

**Here’s how it works:**

Although accrual accounting can provide a more accurate picture of your business’s long-term financial picture, it has the potential to mislead business owners about the current state of their accounts. For example, the aforementioned coffee-table maker would “earn” $800 as soon as she finished her table, for example—but her business bank account might still be empty.
