## Trends Transforming Account Payables in 2023

2. **Automation and AI:** About **15%** of organizations are leveraging AI-based cognitive automation, **30%** are using knowledge-based automation for unstructured data, and a **whopping 36%** are employing rules-based robotic process automation (RPA) for structured data-related tasks. Only a **minuscule 1%** of organizations have not adopted any significant degree of automation, showcasing a massive trend towards automating mundane AP tasks​.
3. **Hyperautomation:** The blend of advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, and RPA is leading towards hyperautomation, making AP processes more efficient and less prone to errors.

## Process of Managing Account Payables

![Accounts Payable process](/img/articles/accounts-payable-process.png "Accounts Payable process")

The journey of managing Account Payables begins the moment a business engages with a supplier. From the receipt of an invoice to the final settlement, each step is like a note in a symphony, and when orchestrated well, it leads to financial harmony. Let’s walk through this journey:

1. **Receipt of Invoices:** The first step in the AP process is the receipt of invoices from suppliers for goods or services provided. These invoices are the tickets to the subsequent processes within the AP department. They detail the goods or services provided, the amount due, and the payment terms.
2. **Verification and Approval:** Upon receipt, each invoice undergoes a verification process to ensure its accuracy and authenticity. This involves matching the invoice with the corresponding purchase order and delivery receipt. For instance, suppose your company ordered **100 units** of a product at **$10** per unit. The invoice should reflect the agreed price and quantity. Any discrepancies need to be resolved before moving forward.
3. **Coding and Posting:** Once verified, invoices are coded with the appropriate account codes and posted to the accounting system. This is where the payable is officially recorded in the books. For example, an invoice for office supplies might be coded to the “Office Supplies Expense” account.
4. **Payment Scheduling and Execution:** After posting, payment schedules are set up based on the payment terms agreed with the suppliers. This is a crucial step as timely payments contribute to good supplier relationships and can sometimes qualify the business for early payment discounts. For instance, a supplier might offer a **2% discount** if the invoice is paid within ten days of receipt.
5. **Record Keeping and Reconciliation:** A meticulous record of all transactions, including payments, is kept for future reference and reconciliation purposes. At the end of a period, say a month or a quarter, the AP balances are reconciled with supplier statements to ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded, and all payables are accounted for.
6. **Reporting and Analysis:** The data collected through the AP process is a gold mine for financial analysis. It provides insights into spending trends, supplier performance, and can help in budgeting and forecasting. For example, analyzing AP data over time might reveal that the cost of certain goods is rising, which could trigger a negotiation with suppliers for better rates or a search for alternative suppliers.

## Results of Efficient Account Payable Management

Managing Account Payables efficiently is akin to steering a ship through stormy seas into calm waters. It’s about navigating the complexities while keeping a keen eye on the financial horizon. Here’s the ripple effect of efficient AP management:

1. **Improved Cash Flow:** Efficient AP processes help in better cash flow management by ensuring that payments are made within favorable terms, thereby retaining more cash in the business for operational needs. For instance, by taking advantage of early payment discounts or simply by avoiding late payment fees, a business can save a significant amount of money over time.
2. **Enhanced Supplier Relationships:** Timely payments and clear communication build trust with suppliers. This trust can translate into better negotiation power, favorable payment terms, and in some cases, priority during supply shortages.
3. **Accurate Financial Reporting:** The precision in managing payables directly impacts the accuracy of financial statements. It ensures that liabilities are correctly recorded, and expenses are matched with revenues, adhering to the accounting principles.
4. **Compliance and Audit Readiness:** With a well-oiled AP process, compliance with regulatory requirements becomes less of a chore. It also ensures that the business is audit-ready at any given time, reducing the stress and disruptions associated with audits.
5. **Strategic Decision-making:** The data and insights garnered from the AP process are invaluable for strategic decision-making. It can provide a clear picture of the company’s expenditure, helping in budgeting, forecasting, and making informed financial decisions.

## Challenges in Account Payable Management

AP Management comes with its share of hurdles that could potentially derail the financial stability of a business if not addressed timely and effectively. Here are some of the common challenges:

● **Manual Processes and Paperwork:** In a world that's swiftly moving towards digitalization, clinging to manual processes and paperwork can be a significant hindrance. Manual data entry, for instance, not only consumes an enormous amount of time but also opens the door to human errors. Imagine entering data from hundreds of invoices manually; the likelihood of errors is substantial, and these errors can be costly.

● **Invoice and Payment Discrepancies:** Discrepancies between invoices and payments can arise from various sources such as incorrect invoicing, disputes over delivered goods or services, or even fraud. Resolving these discrepancies requires a meticulous review process and often involves back-and-forth communication with suppliers, consuming valuable time and resources.

● **Lack of Visibility and Control:** Without a centralized system to manage and monitor AP processes, it's challenging to have real-time visibility into outstanding liabilities, payment statuses, and overall AP performance. This lack of visibility can lead to missed payment deadlines, duplicate payments, or fraud.

● **Compliance and Regulatory Challenges:** The ever-evolving regulatory landscape requires businesses to stay abreast of compliance requirements. Ensuring adherence to tax laws, accounting standards, and other regulatory mandates is crucial to avoid hefty fines and legal complications.

## Best Practices for Effective Account Payable Management

Armed with the knowledge of potential challenges, let’s venture into the strategies that act as a compass guiding businesses through the AP maze.

● **Embrace Automation:** Automation is a boon to the AP department. Tools like [Optical Character Recognition ](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ocr/#:~:text=Optical%20Character%20Recognition%20(OCR)%20is,words%20in%20the%20image%20file.)(OCR) technology can dramatically reduce the time spent on data entry by automatically capturing data from invoices. Similarly, automating the approval workflow can expedite the process, ensuring timely payments.

● **Implement a Robust Approval Workflow:** Establishing a clear approval workflow ensures that invoices are verified and approved by the appropriate personnel before payment. This reduces the likelihood of erroneous payments and helps maintain a strong control environment.

● **Maintain a Centralized Invoice Processing System:** A centralized system provides a bird's-eye view of all AP activities, enabling real-time monitoring and better control over the entire process. It also facilitates easy access to invoice and payment data, which is crucial for effective management and reporting.

● **Regular Reconciliation and Audit Trails:** Regular reconciliation of AP balances with supplier statements and maintaining a clear audit trail of all AP transactions are fundamental for ensuring accuracy and compliance. It also prepares the business for external audits.

● **Vendor Communication and Relationship Management:** Building strong relationships with vendors starts with clear communication. Ensure that vendors are aware of your invoicing requirements, payment terms, and processes. Open channels of communication for resolving discrepancies and other issues will foster a better vendor relationship and could lead to more favorable terms.

● **Continuous Learning and Improvement:** The landscape of Account Payables is dynamic. Investing in continuous learning and staying updated on the latest technologies, best practices, and regulatory requirements is essential for enhancing efficiency and ensuring compliance.
