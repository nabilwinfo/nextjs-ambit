Federal taxes are an important part of the US system of taxation, and understanding them is essential to ensure compliance. This article will provide an overview of federal taxes, including who pays them, when they are due, and how they are calculated. Federal taxes are taxes imposed by the United States government on individuals, businesses, and other entities.

## What Is Federal Tax?

The U.S. federal income tax is levied by the [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/irs.asp) (IRS) on the annual earnings of individuals, corporations, trusts, and other legal entities. Federal income taxes apply to all forms of earnings that make up a taxpayer's [taxable income](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxableincome.asp), including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, tips, investment income, and certain types of unearned income.

## How Is Federal Tax Calculated?

In a nutshell, to estimate taxable income, we take gross income and subtract tax deductions. What's left is taxable income. Then we apply the appropriate tax bracket (based on income and filing status) to calculate tax liability.

## Who Pays Federal Tax?

Federal income taxes are based on your income and filing status; taxes apply to everyone, regardless of where they live or work. Federal income tax liability can be reduced by tax deductions and tax credits, legislation that provides benefits to specific types of taxpayers.

## Tax Brackets

Tax brackets were created by the IRS to implement America’s “progressive” tax system, which taxes higher levels of income at the progressively higher rates we mentioned earlier. The brackets help determine how much money you need to pay the IRS annually.
